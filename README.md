# 🍕 Pizza Sales Data Analysis – SQL + Excel Dashboard  

## 📌 Overview  
Hey everyone! 👋 This is a  data analysis project where I worked with pizza sales data using **SQL & Excel**. I wrote SQL queries to analyze different aspects of sales and then used Excel to create an interactive dashboard for better visualization.  

## 🔧 Tools Used  
- **SQL** – To extract, clean, and analyze the pizza sales data  
- **Excel** – To build the dashboard and visualize key insights  

## 📊 Key Insights  
Here are some interesting things I found from the data:  
👉 **Total Revenue:** $817,860.05  
👉 **Total Orders:** 21,350  
👉 **Best-Selling Pizza:** The Pepperoni Pizza 🍕  
👉 **Worst-Selling Pizza:** The Brie Carre Pizza 😬  
👉 **Peak Order Time:** 12 PM - 1 PM & 5 PM - 6 PM (mostly on weekends)  

## 🚀 How to Use

Set up the database:

RUN pizza.sql to create Database and table.

Run pizza_sales_corrected_inserts.sql to insert the dataset into your SQL database.

Run pizza_sales.sql to generate insights.

Analyze Data:

Modify SQL queries to dig deeper and find more patterns.

View the Dashboard:

## 🔮 Future Improvements  
I plan to:  
✔️ Add more visualizations in Power BI  
✔️ Improve SQL queries for deeper insights  
✔️ Automate the data refresh process
