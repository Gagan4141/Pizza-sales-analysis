# 🍕 Pizza Sales Data Analysis – SQL + Excel Dashboard  

## 📌 Overview  
Hey everyone! 👋 This is a simple yet cool data analysis project where I worked with pizza sales data using **SQL & Excel**. I wrote SQL queries to analyze different aspects of sales and then used Excel to create an interactive dashboard for better visualization.  

## 🔧 Tools Used  
- **SQL** – To extract, clean, and analyze the pizza sales data  
- **Excel** – To build the dashboard and visualize key insights  

## 📊 Key Insights  
Here are some interesting things I found from the data:  
👉 **Total Revenue:** $817,860.05  
👉 **Total Orders:** 21,350  
👉 **Best-Selling Pizza:** The Pepperoni Pizza 🍕  
👉 **Worst-Selling Pizza:** The Brie Carre Pizza 😬  
👉 **Peak Order Time:** 12 PM - 1 PM & 5 PM - 6 PM (mostly on weekends)  

## 🚀 How to Use  
1️⃣ Run the SQL script to set up the database and insert data  
2️⃣ Use SQL queries to explore different insights  
3️⃣ Open the Excel file to check out the interactive dashboard  

## 🔮 Future Improvements  
I plan to:  
✔️ Add more visualizations in Power BI  
✔️ Improve SQL queries for deeper insights  
✔️ Automate the data refresh process
